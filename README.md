## Usage

Add usage here.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run 
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive 
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To 
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run 
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push 
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to 
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Common Tasks

#### Generating an SSH key pair

To generate an SSH key pair:

```
ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096 -C maintainers@infrablocks.io -N '' -f config/secrets/ci/ssh
```

#### Managing CircleCI keys

To encrypt a GPG key for use by CircleCI:

```bash
openssl aes-256-cbc \
  -e \
  -md sha1 \
  -in ./config/secrets/ci/gpg.private \
  -out ./.circleci/gpg.private.enc \
  -k "<passphrase>"
```

To check decryption is working correctly:

```bash
openssl aes-256-cbc \
  -d \
  -md sha1 \
  -in ./.circleci/gpg.private.enc \
  -k "<passphrase>"
```
